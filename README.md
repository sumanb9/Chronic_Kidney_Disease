In this project, I trained a model to predict a patient will suffer from Chronic Kidney Disease or not by analyzing the existing dataset.Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a condition characterized by a gradual loss of kidney function over time.Early detection and treatment can often keep chronic kidney disease from getting worse.

Data set : This project will utilize a dataset of 400 patients and distributed by the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Here is the URL : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/chronic_kidney_disease
